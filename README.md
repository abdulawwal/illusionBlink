# illusionBlink
Final project for Systematic program design part 1 course offered at EDX.
Code shows animations of blinkig illusion that fools our brain that two small circles are not blinking at the same time.
For simplisity reason I used only one data definition in code altough there is room for two more.
Copy code to DrRacket and run.
